					<h2 id="content">System Purpose</h2>
					<p> My Mood is an interactive Alexa application that would improve, assess, and get help for the user's mental state.
						<br><br>Depression not only has an impact on the individual person, it also has a great impact on the society around them.
						Unfortunately, depressed individuals tend to have limited knowledge and access to resources regarding their disorder.
						<br><br>The system provides tools for potentially depressed users, including:
							<ol>
									<li> Depression alleviation through conversation
									<li> Mental health diagnosis by taking an assessment
									<li> Location-based suggestion for professional help
							</ol>
						In addition, collected data from willing users are sent to UCLA for research.
						<br><br>The ultimate goal of the system is to give depressed users a coping mechanism through conversation, and to give them more knowledge of the available resources that can help them.
						Submitted research data would be towards a good cause and simultaneously improve the system.
						By doing so, we hope users will become more aware of their depression by encouraging them be more proactive in curing their depression.
