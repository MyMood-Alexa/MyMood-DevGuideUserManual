          <h2 id="content">System Purpose</h2>
          <p> My Mood is an interactive Alexa application that a user can talk about their day with. The goal of this application is to improve, assess, and get help for the user's mental state.
            <br><br>Depression not only has an impact on the individual person, it also has a great impact on the society around them.
            Unfortunately, depressed individuals tend to have limited knowledge and access to resources regarding their disorder.
            <br><br>The system provides tools for potentially depressed users, including:
              <ol>
                <li>Depression alleviation by telling Alexa about their day</li>
                <li>Mental health diagnosis by taking an assessment based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</li>
                <li>Location-based suggestion for professional help</li>
              </ol>
            The ultimate goal of the system is to give users more knowledge of the available resources that can help their mental state.
            Submitted research data would be towards a good cause and simultaneously improve the system.
            By doing so, we hope users will become more aware of their depression by encouraging them be more proactive in curing their depression.
